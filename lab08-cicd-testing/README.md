Continuous Testing in GitLab: You can configure your gitlab ci pipeline with the testing jobs using different tools provided by GitLab

In this practice session, you will write functions in python that will do several operations related to the csv file. Recall the practice session, where you have prepared the python code that reads a csv file and writes the output to a webpage. 

In addition to above, you will also perform a code quality test. The code quality report will indicate the places in the python files, where your code can further be improved.
