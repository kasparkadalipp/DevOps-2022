# Practice Session 6: Ansible automation tool

Ansible is a simple automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other needs.

The aim of this lab is to get acquainted with the Ansible automation tool and get to know its most commonly used commands.
