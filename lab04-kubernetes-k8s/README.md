# Practice Session 4: Working with Kubernetes

The aim of this practice session is to make you acquainted with Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation [1]. Google originally designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation now maintains the project [1]. 

In this practice session, you are going to deploy the Kubernetes cluster on the ETAIS private cloud. You will also learn to orchestrate and deploy application services using Kubernetes CLI known as kubectl and the kubernetes dashboard (the web UI alternative to CLI). Kubernetes container deployment has several advantages such as high availability, scalability, and faster CI/CD service deployment in the DevOps ecosystem.
